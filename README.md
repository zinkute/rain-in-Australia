In this data science project I am trying to deepen my knowledge about EDA, feature engineering and model creation while trying to predict whether it will be raining tomorrow in Australia.

I try to follow principles described in a book "Veridical Data Science. The Practice of Responsible Data Analysis and Decision Making" by by Bin Yu and Rebecca L. Barter:

The data set is provided in Kaggle:

Folder **data** contains original data file downloaded from Kaggle.

Folder **dslc_documentation** contains Jupyter Notebooks with changes done to the data set in order to conduct analysis.
