Stevenson screen is basically a box with louvres that allow air to circulate around the thermometer inside while protecting it from outside elements like rain and direct sunlight. The outside is painted white to minimise heat absorption. This basic design has been around for about 150 years, and is used by most meteorological organisations around the world. Traditionally, trained observers would read the thermometer and send in the observations at least twice a day—normally at 9 am and 3 pm; but these days we have automatic thermometers that send in the information electronically.

At the end of 24 hours, the amount of water to refill the pan to exactly two inches from its top is measured. Basically evaporation is the amount of water which evaporates from an open pan called a Class A evaporation pan. The rate of evaporation depends on factors such as cloudiness, air temperature and wind speed. Areas in central Australia are very dry, and therefore have a high rate of evaporation. In contrast, coastal areas tend to have a lower evaporation rate as a result of their proximity to a large water source. Areas with low rainfall and low humidity tend to have a high evaporation rate, whilst areas with high rainfall and high humidity tend to have a low evaporation rate.

Warmer air can hold more moisture than cooler air, which means that for a given amount of atmospheric moisture, RH will be lower if air is warm than it would be if the air is cool. This can be seen by comparing the daily 9am maps (higher RH values) with the daily 3pm maps (lower RH values) for any month of the year.

This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers or on the internet. Average sea-level pressure is 1,013.25 hPa. The lowest measurable sea-level pressure is found at the centres of tropical cyclones and tornadoes, with a record low of 870 hPa. The highest sea-level pressure on Earth occurs in Siberia, where the Siberian High often attains a sea-level pressure above 1,050 hPa. A mean sea level pressure chart shows the direct relationship between isobar spacing (pressure gradient) and orientation, and the strength and direction of surface winds. The general rule is that winds are strongest where the isobars are closest together. Thus the strongest winds are usually experienced near cold fronts, low pressure systems and in westerly airstreams south of the continent. Winds are normally light near high pressure systems where the isobars are widely spaced.

    "<strong style=\"color:#c27767\">Humidity:</strong>  relative humidity (RH) is the ratio of how much water vapour is in the air to how much water vapour the air could potentially contain at a given temperature. It varies with the temperature of the air: colder air can contain less vapour, and water will tend to condense out of the air more at lower temperatures. So changing the temperature of air can change the relative humidity, even when the specific humidity remains constant. The humidity in the dataset varies from 0 to 100 %, and that looks accurate.\n",
