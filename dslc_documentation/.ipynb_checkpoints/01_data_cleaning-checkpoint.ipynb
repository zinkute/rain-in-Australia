Stevenson screen is basically a box with louvres that allow air to circulate around the thermometer inside while protecting it from outside elements like rain and direct sunlight. The outside is painted white to minimise heat absorption. This basic design has been around for about 150 years, and is used by most meteorological organisations around the world. Traditionally, trained observers would read the thermometer and send in the observations at least twice a day—normally at 9 am and 3 pm; but these days we have automatic thermometers that send in the information electronically.

At the end of 24 hours, the amount of water to refill the pan to exactly two inches from its top is measured. Basically evaporation is the amount of water which evaporates from an open pan called a Class A evaporation pan. The rate of evaporation depends on factors such as cloudiness, air temperature and wind speed. Areas in central Australia are very dry, and therefore have a high rate of evaporation. In contrast, coastal areas tend to have a lower evaporation rate as a result of their proximity to a large water source. Areas with low rainfall and low humidity tend to have a high evaporation rate, whilst areas with high rainfall and high humidity tend to have a low evaporation rate.

This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers or on the internet. Average sea-level pressure is 1,013.25 hPa. The lowest measurable sea-level pressure is found at the centres of tropical cyclones and tornadoes, with a record low of 870 hPa. The highest sea-level pressure on Earth occurs in Siberia, where the Siberian High often attains a sea-level pressure above 1,050 hPa. A mean sea level pressure chart shows the direct relationship between isobar spacing (pressure gradient) and orientation, and the strength and direction of surface winds. The general rule is that winds are strongest where the isobars are closest together. Thus the strongest winds are usually experienced near cold fronts, low pressure systems and in westerly airstreams south of the continent. Winds are normally light near high pressure systems where the isobars are widely spaced.

    "Below are all domain knowledge details I gathered while briefly looking at the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date**: The dataset has observations from 01/11/2007 till 25/06/2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Locations**: The observations are taken from 49 different locations in Australia, all of them mentioned at least 1500 times. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tempertaure**: Minimum temperature varies from -8.5 (Mount Ginini) to 33.9 (Adelaide), while maximum temperature values are in range from -4.8 (Mount Ginini) to 48.1 (Woomera). Coldest mornings are in Mount Ginini (-7.2), while warmest morning was in PearceRAAF (40.2). The coldest afternoon was noticed in Mount Ginini as well (-5.4), and hottest one happened at Moree (46.7).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rainfall**: the Rainfall data (in mm) looks accurate; the maximum is 371.0 mm per 24 hours, which is considered extremely heavy rain as per below table. Details are taken from the site: https://www.nchm.gov.bt/attachment/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rainfall%20intensity%20classification.pdf\n",

    "\n",
    "**Evaporation**: the process occurs when the water at the surface of a body of water reaches it's gaseous state (water vapour) and is held suspended in the air. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several key weather variables influence this process, noteably: Air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and the net solar radiation absorbed by the body. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If the **air temperature** is high, there is more energy present to convert liquid water to water vapour. \n",
    "* If the **relative humidity** is low, the air mass can more readily suspend more water vapour, hence the energy required to evaporate is less. \n",
    "* If the **incoming solar radiation & subsequent energy** imparted to the body of water (not reflected) is high, again more energy is provided into the system to aid in the transition to water vapour. \n",
    "* If the **Wind Speed** is high, then the air mass at the boundary layer is replaced with air not laden with water vapour (drier) hence more readily able to accept moisture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sunshine**: is the number of hours of bright sunshine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wind**: It looks like in this dataset wind direction is reported in sixteen different clasees (https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Classification-of-wind-directions-in-a-four-sectors-b-eight-sectors-c-sixteen_fig1_221914541; https://windy.app/blog/what-is-wind-direction.html). The first and the most important thing to remember: wind direction is always determined by where the wind is blowing FROM, not where it is blowing towards. We even have degrees (or ordinal values) for different wind directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "0° — north wind (N)  \n",
    "22.5° — north-northeast wind (NNE)  \n",

    "360° — north wind (N)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Humidity**: it was not specified whether the data set holds information about absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH).\n",
    "\n",
    "RH: Relative humidity is the ratio of how much water vapour is in the air to how much water vapour the air could potentially contain at a given temperature. It varies with the temperature of the air: colder air can contain less vapour, and water will tend to condense out of the air more at lower temperatures. So changing the temperature of air can change the relative humidity, even when the specific humidity remains constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "AH: Absolute humidity is the total mass of water vapor (gas form of water) present in a given volume or mass of air. It does not take temperature into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The humidity in the dataset varies from 0 to 100 %, and that looks accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pressure**: the pressure is atmospheric pressure (hpa - hectopascals) reduced to mean sea level\n",
    "\n",
    "Air pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the column of air above the Earth’s surface. It depends on elevation and weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a barometer can let you know if your immediate future will see clearing or stormy skies, or little change at all, based only on atmospheric pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples of how to interpret barometric readings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the air is dry, cool, and pleasant, the barometer reading rises.\n",
    "* In general, a rising barometer means improving weather.\n",
    "* In general, a falling barometer means worsening weather.\n",
    "* When atmospheric pressure drops suddenly, this usually indicates that a storm is on its way.\n",
    "* When atmospheric pressure remains steady, there will likely be no immediate change in the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a barometric pressure of 1000 mb is considered average or normal. High barometric pressure, also known as a high-pressure system, is typically above 1013 mb. It is associated with clear skies, stable weather conditions, and cooler temperatures. On the other hand, low barometric pressure, also known as a low-pressure system, is typically below 1000 mb. It is associated with cloudy or stormy weather, as well as higher temperatures.\n",
